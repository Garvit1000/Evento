3. Firebase Setup
3.1. Create a Firebase project

    Go to the Firebase Console.
    Click on "Add project" and follow the instructions to create a new project.

3.2. Enable Firestore

    In the Firebase Console, go to "Firestore Database" and click on "Create database".
    Choose "Start in test mode" and click "Next".

3.3. Enable Authentication

    In the Firebase Console, go to "Authentication" and click on "Get started".

4. Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the root directory of your project and add the following Firebase configuration variables:

env

    REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
